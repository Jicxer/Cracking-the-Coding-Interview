<p align="center">
  This repository is for personal study. The problem sets that I import are based off the book; "Cracking the Code Interview" by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell.
  Additionally, I will also be conducting leet code problems and analysis.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Book-cover-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jicxer/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/main/images/bookcover.jpg)

In [Cracking the Code Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, interview preparation skills, concepts, and tips are covered along with 189 interview coding questions and provided solutions.
There are 700 pages to this book and while I will not be covering all concepts, various topics such as Big O notation, programming questions, and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) will be covered.

Here's why:
* The programming question provided in the book will provide some code; it would be wise to compile and test around with it.
* Provide documentation of my personal journey with studying.
* Implement my own solutions along with the provided answers.
* Learn Java?

The programming questions for both the book and Leetcode consist of varying difficulties from easy, medium, and hard. I will attempt to cover different levels of difficulties to the best of my ability.

### Prerequisites

The questions covered in the book are mostly coded in Java with an exception with C++. 
However, I will be mostly coding in either Python or C++ for both the book solution and LeetCode implementations.
